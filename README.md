Summary: 

This project developed for CS439 aimed to build a recommendation system for LeetCode problems, using machine learning techniques to suggest problems based on their difficulty, user ratings, and textual descriptions. The dataset was preprocessed and stored in a database, with features engineered to improve problem recommendations. Various models, including an RNN and a BERT-based Transformer, were experimented with to predict relevant problems for users. The model's performance still needs further improvement for better accuracy and personalized recommendations.
